# Core Tech ZRetreat 2025 - Data Mesh Lab

Come join us to get an end-to-end, full loop, hands-on experience for enabling a realistic data-driven business use case where you will:

1) Define, instrument, register and publish events for property saved by our customers as they interact with a web app
2) Land these events in Amplitude and Databricks
3) Enrich these events to add property attributes such as # of beds, baths, zip etc.
4) Create reports and derive insights using AI/BI Dashboards
5) Add ML recommendations for a customer of properties they may like based on the properties they saved
6) Query customer recommendations using a GraphQL graph and surface them on a web app
7) Understand how you would federate the subgraph to ZG Graph

Our goal is to demonstrate how you can self-service yourself and take control of the outcomes you want to drive!
